  <p> I've been doing nails for 6 months now. It hasn't been easy but the impact I've had on people will always be worth it. Its also bonds me and my family together. Moments like that you cherish. 
    They've supported me all the way and I've been so blessed to have such a supportive family helping the world see my greatness.</p>
